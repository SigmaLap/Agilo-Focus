## 📖 About

**Agilo Focus** is a productivity app designed specifically for ADHD brains - not adapted from neurotypical task managers.

### The Problem
Traditional productivity apps fail ADHD users through:
- ❌ Shame-inducing "overdue" tasks
- ❌ Overwhelming complexity
- ❌ Ignoring energy fluctuations
- ❌ Guilt-based productivity mechanics

### Our Solution
- ✅ **No overdue anxiety** - Tasks rotate, they don't expire
- ✅ **Energy-based matching** - Sort tasks by mental load, not arbitrary priority
- ✅ **Shame-free design** - Progress over perfection
- ✅ **ADHD-first** - Built for hyperfocus, accommodates executive dysfunction

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

**1. Constraints over customization**
ADHD brains struggle with too many options. We provide smart defaults and minimal configuration.

**2. Friction elimination**
Every extra tap is a barrier. We optimize for speed: capture → categorize → done.

**3. Positive reinforcement**
Celebrate small wins. No punishment for incomplete tasks. Progress over perfection.

**4. Energy awareness**
Match tasks to your current state. Low energy? Here are low-effort tasks. High energy? Tackle the hard stuff.
